> **Spotify Multi-Add** is a full stack application to search for tracks and add them to more than one of your playlists simultaneously.

## Deployment

The Spotify Multi-Add backend is written in Python, using the [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.1/) library. The API is a Flask WSGI server that is converted into an AWS serverless Lambda function and deployed automatically to AWS via [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa).
